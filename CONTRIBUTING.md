# Contribution Guidelines

**New to GIT and GitHub?** See [these learning resources](https://help.github.com/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/) and this [10 min. GIT tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

These are the main contributing guidelines for the development of this Repository, and apply to each module within. The development structure for this is based on a combination of two things:

* Invited experts as part of a core development team, led by one or two managers for each module.
* Open participation, where anyone can contribute using the standard processes on GitHub.

Feedback and contributions of any form are welcomed. Feel free also to [contact us](https://maastrichtuniversity.nl) to discuss anything further.

At the present, development is in early stages, as this is an entirely crowd-sourced and volunteer-led project.
